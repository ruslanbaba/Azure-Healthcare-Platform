### 2. HIPAA Compliance
- **Data Classification**: PHI (Protected Health Information) properly identified and protected
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all data access and modifications
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with least privilege principle
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies meeting regulatory requirements

### 3. Scalability and Performance
- **Microservices Architecture**: Loosely coupled services for independent scaling
- **Auto-scaling**: Horizontal and vertical scaling based on demand
- **Caching**: Multi-layer caching for improved performance
- **Data Partitioning**: Optimized data layout for query performance

### 4. Observability
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Real-time metrics, logs, and traces
- **Alerting**: Proactive alerts for system health and security events
- **Dashboards**: Interactive dashboards for operational insights
- **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request tracing across services
