```

### Workload Identity Configuration

```bash
# Workload Identity is configured for:
# - Pod-level managed identity authentication
# - Azure service integration without secrets
# - RBAC-based access control

# Verify workload identity setup
kubectl get azureidentity -n healthcare-platform
```

## Step 5: Data Lake Configuration

### Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

```bash
# Data Lake is deployed with:
# - Customer-managed encryption
# - Private endpoint connectivity
# - Hierarchical namespace
# - Bronze/Silver/Gold data zones

# Verify Data Lake configuration

```

### Data Processing Configuration

```bash
# Configure data processing pipelines:
# - Azure Functions for serverless processing
# - Event-driven architecture
# - Automated data validation
# - HIPAA-compliant audit logging
